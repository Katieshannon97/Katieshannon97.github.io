        <p>The notion of making jewelry began when I would pick out an outfit and wish I had a set of jewelry like artwork to go with it. Very few times would I have a necklace and earring set that matched. I would pull out a dress or blouse or sweater and say do I have something that matches this shade of blue, red, turquoise?</p>

        <p1>Even more so to me jewelry was art. My glasses were a piece of jewelry and like necklaces and earrings a statement piece. I would wear my creations and people often would ask where I got them.</p1>
        
            
        <p2>After explaining I made them I was receiving requests, but in a unique niche... custom jewelry to go with that power suit or gown or sweater or summer, spring, fall or winter outfit.</p2>

        <p3>I decided to start a business making unique pieces. One of a kind pieces that I would never duplicate. I love old movies and music and how it makes a girl feel like a lady. Women dressed up to go out and showed grace and class. So many trinkets, crystals and gems to choose from was the notion. Each piece incorporates crystals for a touch of glam.</p3>
